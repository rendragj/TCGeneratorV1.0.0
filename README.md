.CVS-and-Excel-Conversion-Software

*Note this project was terminated before full implementation and was stopped during testing phase. 

Background The HUB TCG, a local shop in Gilroy, CA, operates a specialized machine that processes incoming inventory items and generates data files. This machine outputs a .csv file containing the inventory details; however, the data is unstructured and requires significant formatting adjustments before it can be uploaded to the company’s online store. Previously, employees manually restructured these files to meet the required format, which was time-consuming and prone to errors.

Solution To streamline this process, a custom software solution was developed. This application transforms the raw data generated by the machine into a structured format compatible with the online store’s requirements. The software automates data restructuring, significantly reducing the manual workload for employees.

Technical Details

C#: Used to build a graphical user interface (GUI), making it easy for employees to interact with the software and conversion. The GUI includes functionalities that allow employees to upload and manage the necessary files for data restructuring.

Python: Plays a key role in data transformation. It handles the conversion of data from the machine-generated .csv file to the .xlsx format used by the online database. The program matches primary keys from the .csv file with entries in the existing .xlsx database, producing a new, structured .xlsx file ready for upload. This final output meets the format and structure requirements for the online store.

Impact By automating the data restructuring process, this software has reduced the manual workload by an estimated 25%. Previously, employees would spend hours reformatting the unstructured data, but the new system significantly streamlines this task, allowing staff to focus on higher-value activities.

This solution not only improves efficiency but also ensures greater accuracy in the data uploaded to the online store, enhancing inventory management and reducing the potential for human error.


Improvements involve optimizing code with more machine learning methodologies to quicken process speed in addition to more notes.
